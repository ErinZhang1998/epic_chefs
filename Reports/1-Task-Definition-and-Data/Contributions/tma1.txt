I participated in multiple team meetings to discuss project directions and ideas. Each group member collected background through researched background papers and shared the results. In the data analysis aspect, I focused on visual-related analysis by aggregating information and counts about verb-frame relationship. In the write-up, I focused on video analysis aspects (with related figures) and helped proof read the report.
